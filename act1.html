        <h1> DOG </h1>   
 <p>Highly intelligent, dogs have the capability of expressing their joy and happiness by wagging their tails. They are
known to be the most loyal of animals. Dogs can sense your pain and can be your best friend. They can sense emotions,
and when you are sad, they become sad and when you are happy, they are happy.</p>

<p>Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in
shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house
around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior
sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding,
pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.</p>
